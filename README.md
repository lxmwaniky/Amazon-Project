# Amazon Website Clone

This project is a clone of the Amazon website, created as a learning exercise in full-stack web development.

## Features

- Dynamic product listing: Products are displayed dynamically on the webpage.
- Shopping cart functionality: Users can add products to a shopping cart. If a product is added more than once, the quantity of that product in the cart is automatically updated.

## How It Works

The application uses JavaScript to dynamically generate a list of products and display them on the webpage. Each product has an "Add to Cart" button. When this button is clicked, the product is added to a shopping cart. If the same product is added again, the quantity of that product in the cart is increased by one.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in your web browser to start the application.

## Development

This project uses plain JavaScript. To understand the code, start with `index.js`.
